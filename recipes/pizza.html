    <p>For years, Costco's Supreme Pizza held a special place in the hearts of pizza lovers and Costco members alike. Unfortunately, this legendary pizza, once a staple in the food court lineup, has been taken down, leaving behind a trail of nostalgia and fond memories for those who had the pleasure of savoring its deliciousness.</p>
    <p>What set the Supreme Pizza apart was its abundant toppings. It was generously adorned with a medley of fresh and savory ingredients. Plump, juicy pepperoni slices, savory Italian sausage, green bell peppers, red onions, black olives, and mushrooms adorned the pizza in a colorful and flavorful mosaic. A generous layer of melted, golden cheese held this delightful ensemble together.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball of dough from Kenji's NY Style pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
        <li>a drizzle of olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of red bell pepper, large diced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of green bell pepper, large diced</li>
        <li>2-3 slices red onion, separated</li>
        <li>6-8 slices pepperoni, diced</li>
        <li>~ 1 cup of grated dry mozzarella</li>
        <li>cornmeal for dusting the pizza peel</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In the upper third of your oven, preheat Baking Steel for ~ 1 hour at 500F. Turn up to broil or 550F when ready to bake.</li>
        <li>Dust your pizza peel with flour and cornmeal. Pat the dough into roughly a 10-inch round, careful not to flatten the edges. Make sure it slides easily on the peel.</li>
        <li>Spread the crushed tomatoes on the dough using the back of a spoon, leaving ~1/2 in. border. Sprinkle on the oregano and drizzle with olive oil. Add the mozzarella first, then olives, bell peppers, onion and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake for 7-9 minutes (5-7 if broiling) or until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is well browned. Let rest on a cooling rack for 1-2 minutes. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
